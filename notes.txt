Concurrency in Golang

Channel read is a blocking operation (except in a 'select' construct)
Channel write operation is also a blocking operation
    Write operation can succeed ONLY if a read operation is initiated (unless the channel is a buffered channel)
    Delivery of the data is guaranteed

func fn(){
    ...
    go f1()
    time.Sleep(20 * time.Second)
    ........
    
    x := <- ch
    
    ........
}

func f1(){
    ch <- 100
}

func fn(){
    select {
        case x:= <- ch:
            ...
        case <- time.After(time.Second):
            ...
        default:
            ...
    }
}

Higher Order Functions
    1. A function can be assigned as a value to a variable
    2. A function can be passed as an argument to a function
    3. A function can be returned by another function
